Build the XPI
===============
You can build an XPI for installation by running the build.sh script located in this folder.

For development you should do the following:
    1. Unzip the entire contents of this package to somewhere,
        e.g, c:\dev or /home/user/dev
    2. Put the full path to the folder (e.g. c:\dev\gpgauth on
        Windows, /home/user/dev/gpgauth on Linux) in a file named
        gpgauth@gpgauth.org and copy that file to
        [your profile folder]\extensions\
    3. Restart Firefox.

To create the XPI bundle -
    1. from this directory, execute ./config_build.sh
    2. also from this directory, execute ./build.sh
    3. drop the generated xpi file into a running instance
        of firefox and restart firefox.

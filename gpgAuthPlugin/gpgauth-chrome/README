This folder contains the chrome extension - in the directory './plugin/linux/i386/' is a link to the npgpgAuthPlugin.so shared object, the link will need to be updated to match your build location for firebreath.

Otherwise, add extension from chrome - it will carry the NPAPI plugin so there is no need to install the NPAPI plugin manually.
